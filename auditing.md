#Summary
Catalyze shall audit access and activity of electronic protected health information (ePHI) applications and systems in order to ensure compliance. The Security Rule requires healthcare organizations to implement reasonable hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI.  Audit activities may be limited by application, system, and/or network auditing capabilities and resources. Catalyze shall make reasonable and good-faith efforts to safeguard information privacy and security through a well-thought-out approach to auditing that is consistent with available resources.

It is the policy of Catalyze to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of applications, systems, and networks.  To ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place and effective, Catalyze shall audit access and activity to detect, report, and guard against:

* Network vulnerabilities and intrusions;
* Breaches in confidentiality and security of patient protected health information;
* Performance problems and flaws in applications;
* Improper alteration or destruction of ePHI.This policy applies to all Catalyze systems that store, transmit, or process ePHI.

#Auditing Policies
1. Responsibility for auditing information system access and activity is assigned to Catalyze’s Security Officer.  The Security Officer shall:
	2. Assign the task of generating reports for audit activities to the workforce member responsible for the application, system, or network;
	3. Assign the task of reviewing the audit reports to the workforce member responsible for the application, system, or network, the Privacy Officer, or any other individual determined to be appropriate for the task;
	4. Organize and provide oversight to a team structure charged with audit compliance activities (e.g., parameters, frequency, sample sizes, report formats, evaluation, follow-up, etc.).

2.	Catalyze’s auditing processes shall address access and activity at the following levels listed below.  Auditing processes may address date and time of each log-on attempt, date and time of each log-off attempt, devices used, functions performed, etc.
	3. User:  User level audit trails generally monitor and log all commands directly initiated by the user, all identification and authentication attempts, and data and services accessed.
	4. Application:   Application level audit trails generally monitor and log all user activities, including data accessed and modified and specific actions.
	5. System:  System level audit trails generally monitor and log user activities, applications accessed, and other system defined specific actions.
	6. Network:  Network level audit trails generally monitor information on what is operating, penetrations, and vulnerabilities.
