Catalyze is committed to ensuring the confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and availability of all electronic protected health information (ePHI) it creates, receives, maintains, and/or transmits on behalf of its customers. As providers of compliant infrastructure used by health technology vendors, developers, designers, agencies, custom development  shops, and enterprises, Catalyze strives to maintain compliance, proactively address information security, mitigate risk for its customers, and assure known breaches are completely and effectively communicated. The following documents address core policies used by Catalyze to maintain compliance and assure the proper protections of infrastructure used to store, process, and trasmit ePHI for Catalyze customers.


Catalyze, Inc (“Catalyze”) provides secure and compliant cloud-based software. This hosted software falls into two broad offerings: 1) **Platform as a Service (Paas)** and 2) **Platform Add-ons**.

#Key Definitions

* *Application*:

* *BaaS*:

* *Audit*:  Internal process of reviewing information system access and activity (e.g., log-ins, file accesses, and security incidents).  An audit may be done as a periodic event, as a result of a patient complaint, or suspicion of employee wrongdoing.

* *Audit Controls*:  Technical mechanisms that track and record computer/system activities.* *Audit Logs*:  Encrypted records of activity maintained by the system which provide:  1) date and time of activity; 2) origin of activity (app); 3) identification of user doing activity; and 4) data accessed as part of activity.

* *Access*:   Means the ability or the means necessary to read, write, modify, or communicate data/ information or otherwise use any system resource.

* *Backup Service*:* *Breach*:  Means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI.  For purpose of this definition, “compromises the security or privacy of the PHI” means poses a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual.  A use or disclosure of PHI that does not include the identifiers listed at §164.514(e)(2), limited data set, date of birth, and zip code does not compromise the security or privacy of the PHI. Breach excludes:

	1. Any unintentional acquisition, access or use of PHI by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a Covered Entity (CE) or Business Associate (BA) if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or disclosure in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.
	2. Any inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorized to access PHI at a CE or BA to another person authorized to access PHI at the same CE or BA, or organized health care arrangement in which the CE participates, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or disclosed in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.
	3. A disclosure of PHI where a CE or BA has a good faith belief that an unauthorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information. * *Business Associate*: a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of, or provides services to, a covered entity. * *Covered Entity*:  A health plan, health care clearinghouse, or a healthcare provider who transmits any health information in electronic form. 

* *De-identification*:

* *Disaster Recovery*:* *Disclosure*:  Disclosure means the release, transfer, provision of, access to, or divulging in any other manner of information outside the entity holding the information.

* *Customers*:

* *Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)*:  Any individually identifiable health information protected by HIPAA that is transmitted by, processed in some way, or stored in electronic media. 

* *Environment*:'

* *Health and Human Services (HHS)*:

* *Individually Identifiable Health Information*:  That information that is a subset of health information, including demographic information collected from an individual, and is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse; and relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual; and identifies the individual; or with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe  the information can be used to identify the individual. * *Law Enforcement Official*:  Any officer or employee of an agency or authority of the United States, a State, a territory, a political subdivision of a State or territory, or an Indian tribe, who is empowered by law to investigate or conduct an official inquiry into a potential violation of law; or prosecute or otherwise conduct a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding arising from an alleged violation of law.

* *Logging Service*:* *Organization*:  For the purposes of this policy, the term “organization” shall mean Catalyze.

* *Partner*:

* *Platform*:* *Protected Health Information (PHI)*:  Individually identifiable health information that is created by or received by the organization, including demographic information, that identifies an individual, or provides a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify an individual, and relates to:  	* Past, present or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual.
	* The provision of health care to an individual.
	* The past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual.* *Sanitization*:  Removal or the act of overwriting data to a point of preventing the recovery of the data on the device or media that is being sanitized. Sanitization is typically done before re-issuing a device or media, donating equipment that contained sensitive information or returning leased equipment to the lending company.* *Trigger Event*:  Activities that may be indicative of a security breach that require further investigation (See Appendix).

* *Unsecured Protected Health Information*:   Protected health information (PHI) that is not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals through the use of technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in the guidance issued under section 13402(h)(2) of Pub. L.111-5 on the HHS website.
	1. Electronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security rule by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached.  To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt.  The following encryption processes meet this standard.
		* Valid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems) are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices.
		* Valid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission) are those that comply, as appropriate, with NIST Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) 	Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, and may include others which are Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 140-2 validated.
	2.  The media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways:
		*  Paper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed.  Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.
		*  Electronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST 	Special Publications 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, such that the PHI cannot be retrieved.* *Workforce*:  Means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for a covered entity, is under the direct control of such entity, whether or not they are paid by the covered entity. #Version Control
