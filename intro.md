Catalyze, Inc ("Catalyze") is committed to ensuring the confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and availability of all electronic protected health information (ePHI) it receives, maintains, processes and/or transmits on behalf of its Customers. As providers of compliant, hosted infrastructure used by health technology vendors, developers, designers, agencies, custom development  shops, and enterprises, Catalyze strives to maintain compliance, proactively address information security, mitigate risk for its Customers, and assure known breaches are completely and effectively communicated in a timely manner. The following documents address core policies used by Catalyze to maintain compliance and assure the proper protections of infrastructure used to store, process, and trasmit ePHI for Catalyze Customers.

Catalyze provides secure and compliant cloud-based software. This hosted software falls into two broad categoring: 1) **Platform as a Service (Paas)** and 2) **Platform Add-ons**. These Categories are cited throughout polices as Customers in each category inherit different policices, procedures, and obligations from Catalyze.

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
==================
PaaS Customers utilized hosted software and infrastructure from Catalyze to deploy, host, and scale custom developed applications and configured databases. These customers are deployed into compliant containers run on systems secured and managed by Catalyze. Catalyze does not have insight or access into application level data of PaaS Customers and, as such, does not have the ability to secure or manage risk associated with application level vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. Catalyze makes every effort to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure, access, and/or breach of PaaS Customer data through network (firewalls, dedicated IP spaces, etc) and server settings (encryption at rest and in transit, OSSEC throughout the Platform, etc).

PaaS Customers can opt for a list of Services from Catalyze, which include Backup Service, Logging Service, IDS Service, and Disaster Recovery Service. These services are not standard and PaaS Customers must sign up for them in order for Catalyze to manage these areas of security and compliance.

Platform Add-ons (or "Add-ons")
==================
Add-ons are API-driven services that are offered as part of the Catalyze Platform. These services currently include our Backend as a Service and secure Messaging Service. With Add-ons, Catalyze has access to data models and manages all application level configurations and security.

In the future there may be 3rd party Add-on services available as part of the Catalyze Platform. These 3rd party, or Partner, Services will be fully reviewed by Catalyze to assure they do not have a negative impact on Catalyze's information security and compliance posture.

#Key Definitions

* *Application*: An application hosted by Catalyze, either maintained and created by Catalyze, or maintaiend and created by a Customer or Partner.

* *Application Level*: Controls and security associated with an Application. In the case of PaaS Customers, Catalzye does not have access to and cannot assure compliance with security standards and policies at the Application Level.

* *Audit*:  Internal process of reviewing information system access and activity (e.g., log-ins, file accesses, and security incidents).  An audit may be done as a periodic event, as a result of a patient complaint, or suspicion of employee wrongdoing.

* *Audit Controls*:  Technical mechanisms that track and record computer/system activities.* *Audit Logs*:  Encrypted records of activity maintained by the system which provide:  1) date and time of activity; 2) origin of activity (app); 3) identification of user doing activity; and 4) data accessed as part of activity.

* *BaaS*: Backend-as-a-Service. A set of APIs, and associated SDKs, for rapid mobile and web application development. APIs offer the ability to create users, do authentication, store data, and store files.

* *Backup*: The process of making an electronic copy of data stored in a computer system. This can either be complete, meaning all data and programs, or incremental, including just the data that changed from the previous backup.

* *Backup Service*: A logging service for unifying system and application logs, encrypting them, and providing a dashboard for them. Offered with all Catalyze Add-ons and as an option for PaaS Customers.* *Breach*:  Means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI.  For purpose of this definition, “compromises the security or privacy of the PHI” means poses a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual.  A use or disclosure of PHI that does not include the identifiers listed at §164.514(e)(2), limited data set, date of birth, and zip code does not compromise the security or privacy of the PHI. Breach excludes:

	1. Any unintentional acquisition, access or use of PHI by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a Covered Entity (CE) or Business Associate (BA) if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or disclosure in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.
	2. Any inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorized to access PHI at a CE or BA to another person authorized to access PHI at the same CE or BA, or organized health care arrangement in which the CE participates, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or disclosed in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.
	3. A disclosure of PHI where a CE or BA has a good faith belief that an unauthorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information. * *Business Associate*: a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of, or provides services to, a covered entity. * *Covered Entity*:  A health plan, health care clearinghouse, or a healthcare provider who transmits any health information in electronic form.

* *Indication*:  A sign that an Incident may have occurred or may be occurring at the present time.  Examples of indications include:
	* The network intrusion detection sensor alerts when a known exploit occurs against an FTP server.  Intrusion detection is generally reactive, looking only for footprints of known attacks.  It is important to note that many IDS “hits” are also false positives and are neither an event nor an incident;
	* The antivirus software alerts when it detects that a host is infected with a worm;
	* Users complain of slow access to hosts on the Internet;
	* The system administrator sees a filename with unusual characteristics;

	* Alerts as a result of detecting malicious code at the network and host levels;
	* Alerts from file integrity checking software;
	* Audit log alerts.
* *Risk*:  The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, and the impact of that event on the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of ePHI, other confidential or proprietary electronic information, and other system assets.* *Risk Management Team*: Individuals who are knowledgeable about the Organization’s HIPAA Privacy, Security and HITECH policies, procedures, training program, computer system set up, and technical security controls, and who are responsible for the risk management process and procedures outlined below.* *Risk Assessment*:  (Referred to as Risk Analysis in the HIPAA Security Rule); the process:
	* Identifies the risks to information system security and determines the probability of occurrence and the resulting impact for each threat/vulnerability pair identified given the security controls in place;
	* Prioritizes risks; and
	* Results in recommended possible actions/controls that could reduce or offset the determined risk.* *Risk Management*:  Within this policy, it refers to two major process components: risk assessment and risk mitigation. This differs from the HIPAA Security Rule, which defines it as a risk mitigation process only. The definition used in this policy is consistent with the one used in documents published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).* *Risk Mitigation*:  Referred to as Risk Management in the HIPAA Security Rule, and is a process that prioritizes, evaluates, and implements security controls that will reduce or offset the risks determined in the risk assessment process to satisfactory levels within an organization given its mission and available resources.

* *Security Incident* (or just Incident):  A security incident is an occurrence that exercises a significant adverse effect on people, process, technology, or data.  Security incidents include, but are not limited to: 
	* A system or network breach accomplished by an internal or external entity; this breach can be inadvertent or malicious;
	* Unauthorized disclosure;
	* Unauthorized change or destruction of ePHI (i.e. delete dictation, data alterations not following Catalyze’s procedures);
	* Denial of service not attributable to identifiable physical, environmental, human or technology causes;
	* Disaster or enacted threat to business continuity;
	* Information Security Incident:  A violation or imminent threat of violation of information security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.  Examples of information security incidents may include, but are not limited to, the following:

	* Other – explosions, medical emergencies, misuse or resources, etc. * *Threat Source*: Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm (intentional or unintentional) to an IT system.  Common threat sources can be natural, human or environmental which can impact the organization’s ability to protect ePHI.  * *Threat Action*: The method by which an attack might be carried out (e.g., hacking, system intrusion, etc.).

* *Unrestricted Area*: those areas of the building(s) where protected health information and/or sensitive organizational information is not stored or is not utilized or is not accessible there on a regular basis.

* *Unsecured Protected Health Information*:   Protected health information (PHI) that is not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals through the use of technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in the guidance issued under section 13402(h)(2) of Pub. L.111-5 on the HHS website.
	1. Electronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security rule by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached.  To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt.  The following encryption processes meet this standard.
		* Valid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems) are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices.
		* Valid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission) are those that comply, as appropriate, with NIST Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) 	Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, and may include others which are Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 140-2 validated.
	2.  The media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways:
		*  Paper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed.  Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.
		*  Electronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST 	Special Publications 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, such that the PHI cannot be retrieved.* *Vendors*: persons from other organizations marketing or selling products or services, or providing services to Catalyze. * *Vulnerability*:  A weakness or flaw in an information system that can be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited by a threat and lead to a compromise in the integrity of that system, i.e., resulting in a security breach or violation of policy.
* *Workstation*:  An electronic computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or any other device that performs similar functions, used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.  Workstation devices may include, but are not limited to: laptop or desktop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet PCs, and other handheld devices.  For the purposes of this policy, “workstation” also includes the combination of hardware, operating system, application software, and network connection.* *Workforce*:  Means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for a covered entity, is under the direct control of such entity, whether or not they are paid by the covered entity. #Catalyze Organizational Concepts

The physical infrastructure environment is hosted at Rackspace and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The network components and supporting network infrastructure is contained within AWS and Rackspace infrastructure and managed by Rackspace and AWS. Catalyze does not have physical access into the network components. The Catalyze environment consists of Cisco firewalls, Apache web servers, Dropwizard Java application servers, Percona and Riak database servers, Logstash logging servers, Linux Ubuntu monitoring servers, Puppet access control server, OSSEC IDS services, Docker containers, Linux CentOS bastion host, and developer tools servers running on Linux Ubuntu.

Within the Catalyze Platform, both on Rackspace and AWS, all data transmission is encrypted and all hard drives are encrypted so data at rest is also encrypted; this applies to all servers - those hosting Docker containes, databases, APIs, log servers, etc. Catalyze assumes all data *may* contain ePHI, even though our Risk Assessment does not indicate this is the case, and provides appropriate protections based on that assumption.

In the case of PaaS Customers, it is the responsilibity of the Customer to restrict, secure, and assure the privacy of all ePHI data at the Application Level, as this is not under the control or perview of Catalyze.There is data and network segmentation in place but differently implemented on Rackspace and AWS versions of the Catalyze Platform.

* With Rackspace, hosted load balancers segment data and traffic while Cisco firewalls route traffic to private subnets for each PaaS Customer and for Platform Add-ons.
* With AWS, hosted load balancers segment data across dedicated Virtual Privare Clouds for each PaaS Customer and for Platform Add-ons.

The result of segmentation strategies employed by Catalyze effectively create RFC 1918, or dedicated, private segmented and separated networks and IP spaces, for each PaaS Customer and for Platform Add-ons. 

Additionally, IPtables is used on each each server for logical segmentation. The IPtables are configured to restrict access to only justified ports and protocols. Catalyze has implemented strict logical access controls so that only authorized personnel are given access to the internal management servers. The environment is configured so that data is transmitted from the load balancers to the application servers over an SSL encrypted session.

In the case of Platform Add-ons, once the data is received from the application server, a series of Application Programming Interface (API) calls is made to the database servers where the ePHI resides. The ePHI is separated into Riak and Percona databases through programming logic built, so that access to one database server will not present you with the full ePHI spectrum. The bastion host, Apache web server, Dropwizard application servers are externally facing and accessible via the Internet. The database servers, where the ePHI resides, are located on the internal Catalyze network and can only be accessed directly over an SSH connection through the bastion host. The access to the internal database is restricted to a limited number of personnel and strictly controlled to only those personnel with a business justified reason. Remote access to the internal servers is not accessible except through the load balancers and bastion host.

All Platform Add-ons and operating systems are tested end-to-endfor usability, security and impact prior to deployment to production.#Version Control
