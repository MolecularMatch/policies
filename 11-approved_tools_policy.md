# Approved Tools Policy

MolecularMatch utilizes a suite of approved software tools for internal use by workforce members. These software tools are either self-hosted, with security managed by us, or they are hosted by a Subcontractor with appropriate business associate agreements in place to preserve data integrity. Use of other tools requires approval from leadership, and modification of this policy to reflect that approval.
