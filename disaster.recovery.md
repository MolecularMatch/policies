#Summary
The Catalyze Contingency Plan establishes procedures to recover Catalyze following a disruption resulting from a disaster. The following objectives have been established for this plan: 

1. Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan that consists of the following phases:
	2. *Assessment Phase* to assess the extent and verify the disaster;
	3. *Notification/Activation phase* to detect and assess damage and to activate the plan;
	4. *Recovery phase* to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage done to the original system;
	5. *Reconstitution phase* to restore IT system processing capabilities to normal operations.
6. Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out Catalyze processing requirements during prolonged interruptions to normal operations. 
7. Assign responsibilities to designated OPDIV personnel and provide guidance for recovering Catalyze during prolonged periods of interruption to normal operations. 
8. Ensure coordination with other Catalyze staff who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.
9. Ensure coordination with external points of contact and vendors who will participate in the contingency planning strategies. 

This Catalyze Contingency Plan has been developed as required under the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, November 2000, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Final Security Rule, Section §164.308(a) (7), which requires the establishment and implementation of procedures for responding to events that damage systems containing electronic protected health information. This Catalyze Contingency Plan is promulgated under the legislative requirements set forth in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the guidelines established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-34, titled "Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems" dated June 2002.

This Catalyze Contingency Plan complies with the OPDIV IT Contingency Planning Policy as follows:
> The organization shall develop a contingency planning capability to meet the needs of critical supporting operations in the event of a disruption extending beyond 48 hours. The procedures for execution of such a capability shall be documented in a formal contingency plan and shall be reviewed at least annually and updated as necessary. Personnel responsible for target systems shall be trained to execute contingency procedures. The plan, recovery capabilities, and personnel shall be tested to identify weaknesses of the capability at least annually. The Catalyze Contingency Plan also complies with the following federal and departmental policies:

* The Computer Security Act of 1987;
* OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, November 2000;
* Federal Preparedness Circular (FPC) 65, Federal Executive Branch Continuity of Operations, July 1999;
* Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 67, Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations, October 1998;
