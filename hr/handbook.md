This Catalyze Employee Handbook (this “Handbook”) is current as of January 10th, 2014. All employees will be informed of updates to this Handbook going forward. Access to this Handbook is provided to all employees at all times. If there are any questions or concerns about this Handbook, or any reports of violations, employees should contact [hr@catalyze.io](hr@catalyze.io)

##Introduction
Welcome to Catalyze! We’re excited to have you on our team. We’re a pretty new company but we’re funded and growing very fast. We’re on a mission to solve the compliance challenges facing healthcare technology vendors. We are governed by a Board of Directors, with Mohan and Travis sitting on the Board.
  
We’re a distributed team with a primary office in Madison, WI. We also have a small office in San Antonio, TX, and shared space in Washington, DC. Being distributed means we strive to assure all communication is equally accessible, whether communicating with the person sitting next to you or a person across the country. Below is our current organizational chart, showing where everybody sits and how we all work together. We’re very flat, so all people on the org are always accessible via email or, preferably, chat.

##Onboarding
As part of the onboarding process, you should have received and co-signed an offer letter and an at-will employment agreement. The at-will employment address areas related to intellectual property (IP), while the offer letter really just lays out the high level terms of employment.

One specific area to highlight and explain is option grants. Options give you the right, or option, to buy shares of Catalyze at a certain price. The terms for all option grants, other than the price of the options, are standardized for all employees at Catalyze; these terms mirror the terms of founders grants. Specifically, options are vested over 4 years with a 1 year cliff. What this means is that your options, if you choose to use them and buy shares, are not owned by you until they are vested. You would vest ¼ of your total shares after 12 months, and then 1/36 of the remaining shares on each month for the next 3 years. If you leave Catalyze before 12 months, you do not vest, or own any shares. If you leave between 12 months and 4 years, you would own or have vested a percentage of your shares. If you have any questions about options or terms, please email [hr@catalyze.io](hr@catalyze.io).

You should have received onboarding information from our HR and benefits companies. Currently we’re using Maxwell Health for insurance and we’re using inDinero for HR/Payroll.  We currently direct deposit salary two times per month. We also offer full medical coverage through Group Health Cooperative and Catalyze covers 100% of the cost. If you have not received information from Maxwell and inDinero, and completed the paperwork for each, please email hr@catalyze.io.

You should be setup with accounts for the services we use. Those services include:

* Google apps - calendar, email, Google + (for hangouts)
* Slack - daily group and 1:1 chat
* Github - code and policy version control and code repositories
* Box - secure file storage and sharing
* Trello - less frequent use, more high level planning
* Github Issues - sprint and task tracking
* iDoneThis - daily status updates

If you do not have credentials for or you have questions about any of the services listed above please reach out to travis@catalyze.io, brian@catalyze.io, or ben@catalyze.io.

You each should have been issued a Mac Book Pro for use at Catalyze. This is for work use and, because of the nature of compliance, it is imperative that our workstation policies (firewall, encryption, passwords) are enforced. Please email if you have questions about any of these. The machine belongs to Catalyze Inc. and must be returned before you leave the company.

##Policies
###Professionalism
At all times, and in all circumstances where employee is acting on behalf of Catalyze or is seen to be associated with Catalyze, the employee is to act in a professional manner. This includes statements about, pertaining to, or somehow relating to Catalyze, its employees, its partners, its customers, or its competitors.

###Accountability
Every Catalyze employee, from founder to janitor, is accountable for their work. We will recognize and celebrate your successes, and we will will also explore when mistakes are made, or things do not go as planned. Our objective as a company is to constantly learn and improve, and we want each and every one of us to constantly learn and improve because, well, we are the company. We will give you enough rope to hang yourself, or to lasso the biggest bull you can find. The choice is yours. In a sense our ideal team is made up of startups of one - each of you own your work and take initiative to succeed. You also explore and test constantly, documenting what you learned in some way that we all benefit.

###Working
We expect all employees at Catalyze to be available during business hours unless other arrangements have been made. There is flexibility in hours, and work location, but you should generally be available via chat every day. We don’t count hours but plan for all work to be completed as if you are working full time. Full time doesn’t mean 40 hours, but it means getting your work done and delivered by deadlines, or letting us know why certain deadlines are not realistic. If you are a remote worker, this does place an additional burden on you to provide transparency and visibility into your work and availability.
Internet Use. We expect Internet use while on the company network, or anytime with the company’s computer, to be professional in nature. Do not frequent sites with questionable content at any time. If you need additional clarification on this, please email hr@catalzye.io.

###Communication
* *Task Management Software and HipChat*. The objective of internal communication is to make all, or as much as possible, contextual, fast, and easy to manage. As such, the majority of communication should take place via HipChat, iDoneThis, and Jira/Confluence. For any of these, if you want a response from a specific person or a group of people, be sure that you @mention them. Regarding HipChat, if you want to share a link or something else of interest with the whole company, please post that to the catalyze.io main room. If you want to create a HipChat room, please do so but make sure you post an announcement of the room to the entire group with @all.
Email. Email is rarely the best choice, but is still the preferred method of communication when a formal response is required within 24 hours. In this case, it is expected that a response will be given within 24 hours, even if that response is only to state that a full response should be expected in a certain amount of time. This policy applies to both internal and external email.
* *Google Hangouts*. It is expected that when you are working you will be available for Hangouts on demand. Being a geographically dispersed teams requires that we stay available, and that sometimes requires more than HipChat/IM.
* *Phone*. Phone, meaning voice or text (SMS/iMessage) is not the preferred method for internal communication. It should be used sparingly as it is a distraction and a drain on productivity.

###Meetings

* *Daily Meetings*. Company-wide daily meetings are held every morning from 10:00-10:15 AM CST. All employees are required to attend. If an employee cannot make the meeting because of known circumstances, the founders of Catalyze are to be informed the day before or the morning of by email (founders@catalyze.io). Local, WI-based employees are required to attend in person while remote employees are required to use the communication medium of choice, currently Google Hangouts with phone for backup(888-245-6744). At such meetings, each employee should be prepared to talk about what they plan to accomplish that day and any help they might need in accomplishing it. The goal is to make it very actionable items that can realistically be completed that day. That may mean portions of a larger task. Ben will run these meetings.
* *Retrospectives*. At the conclusion of each sprint we hold retrospectives, which run for about an hour. During this time we celebrate our success over the sprint, and try to learn and improve by recognizing and acknowledging mistakes and areas of improvement.
* *1 on 1 Meetings*. At least every 2 weeks you should sit down, or the very least have a call, with either Ben, Mohan, Nick or Travis to discuss how things are going - what is working, what is not working, what can we do to make things better.

###Benefits
 
Your salary or wage will be reviewed every 12 months and adjusted in line with your performance and commiserate, to an extent, with the stage of the company. The review process will be largely informal, transparent, and participatory for you. The salary review process will take into account your performance in your role, market rates for you role and Catalyze’s ability to pay. Reviews will not necessarily lead to an increase.
 
###Expense reimbursement
 
Where expenses have been incurred in the performance of your duties, and provided that you have obtained your manager’s approval to incur the expense, Catalyze will reimburse you for all reasonable travel and other expenses incurred as part of undertaking your role. You should submit all receipts in accordance with the expenses claimed for all expenses over $25. All expenses should be documented and submitted through Expensify.
 
###Performance Development
  
The aim of our performance appraisal process is to provide you with guidance, to help you to achieve your job and career goals, to recognise your achievements. You will have the opportunity to participate in planning your work and setting your goals in conjunction with on an ongoing basis and during your annual appraisal meeting. You will provide you with regular coaching and feedback. The performance appraisal process is an opportunity for two way communication and honest feedback about your work and your future career.
 
Catalyze sees the training and development of its employees as essential to achieving its goals. You are invited to discuss your training needs during your formal performance appraisal meeting or with your immediate manager at any time. This might include formal classes, certificates, online training, and/or conferences. Founders are responsible for approving all training or courses of study.
