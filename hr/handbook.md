This MolecularMatch Employee Handbook (this “Handbook”) is current as of November 20th, 2014. All employees will be informed of updates to this Handbook going forward. Access to this Handbook is provided to all employees at all times. If there are any questions or concerns about this Handbook, or any reports of violations, employees should contact [Kevin Coker](mailto:kcoker@molecularmatch.com).

##Introduction
Welcome! We’re excited to have you on our team. We’re on a mission to solve many of the challenges facing healthcare. Ask any patient or physician, and they'll tell you the problems we are solving are very real, tangible, and immediately in need of better solutions. 

We're focused on building web applications and knowledge management to improve access to clinical trials and pharmaceuticals, specifically cloud-based software infrastructure, that makes it simpler for developers, vendors, and enterprises to build the tools necessary to fix healthcare. Healthcare is in need of a renaisance, and we want to help innovators bring about that paradigm shift. We're noting (yes, the name was intentional) the disruption of healthcare with innovative technology and tech-enabled services built using the Company's products. Our vision is to be *the* backbone, or plumbing, for healthcare technology, assuring the availability, privacy, security, and integrity of data.

As a company:

* we like to have fun;
* we work very hard;
* we learn constantly;
* we ask questions;
* we get better every day;
* we fight to win;
* we help each other;
* we love our customers;
* we are accountable;
* we accept failure but don't like it.

##Organization
**What is the organizational structure?**  
**Who sits on the board?**  
**Talk about financing? Who lead your series A?  Provide some background/transparency?**  
**Who is on the leadership team?**

~~We're governed by a Board of Directors, with Mohan and Travis sitting on the Board from the company leadership. We raised a Series A funding round in November 2013. Our major funders are Arthur Ventures, Chicago Ventures, and Baird Ventures. WHO is CEO and Chief Privacy Officer. WHO is President and Chief Product Officer. WHO is CTO and Chief Security Officer.~~
  
We’re a distributed team with a primary office in Houston, TX. We also have a small office in Los Angelos, CA. Being distributed means we work hard to assure all communication is equally accessible, whether communicating with the person sitting next to you or a person across the country. Below is our current organizational chart, showing where everybody sits and how we all work together. We’re very flat, so all people on the org are always accessible via email or, preferably, chat.  
**((What is your communication protocol? Email? GDocs? Chat Client?))**

##Onboarding
As part of the onboarding process, you should have received and co-signed an offer letter and an at-will employment agreement. The at-will employment addresses areas related to intellectual property (IP), while the offer letter really just lays out the high level terms of employment. If you have not recieved these, please email [Kevin Coker](mailto:kcoker@molecularmatch.com).

One specific area to highlight and explain is option grants. Options give you the right, or option, to buy shares of the Company at a certain price. The terms for all option grants, other than the price of the options, are standardized for all employees; these terms mirror the terms of founders grants. Specifically, options are vested over 4 years with a 1 year cliff. What this means is that your options, if you choose to use them and buy shares, are not owned by you until they are vested. You would vest ¼ of your total shares after 12 months, and then 1/36 of the remaining shares on each month for the next 3 years. If you leave the Company before 12 months, you do not vest, or own any shares. If you leave between 12 months and 4 years, you would own or have vested a percentage of your shares. If you have any questions about options or terms, please email [Kevin Coker](kcoker@molecularmatch.com).

You should have received onboarding information from our HR and benefits companies. Currently we’re using **((Who Health Insurnace?))** for insurance and we’re using **((Who for HR/Payroll))** for HR/Payroll.  We  direct deposit salary two times per month. We also offer full medical coverage through **((Any other coverage??))**. If you have not received information from these companies, and completed the paperwork for each, please email [Kevin Coker](mailto:kcoker@molecularmatch.com). If you have questions about payroll or direct deposit, please email **((Who email??))**.

You should be setup with accounts for the services we use. Those services include:

* Google apps - calendar, email, Google + (for Hangouts)
* Github - code and policy version control and code repositories  
**((What other tools??))**

If you do not have credentials for or you have questions about any of the services listed above please complete the **System Access Form**. If you want to change credentials, use the same **System Access Form**.  These forms and all other policies can be found in the policies repository on GitHub. 

**((What will the final workplace and workstation policies be??))**  
~~You each should have been issued a Mac Book Pro for use at the Company.~~  
This is for work use and, because of the nature of compliance, it is imperative that our workstation policies (firewall, encryption, passwords) are enforced. Specific policies for workstation uses can be found in the workstation section of the **Employees Policy** on GitHub. Please email if you have questions about any of these. ~~The machine belongs to the Company Inc. and must be returned if you leave the company.~~

##HIPAA
 
###Compliance Policies

As an organization, compliance and security are at the core of what we do and how we operate. ~~We publically post our policies and procedures, and can be referenced whenever you have a question related to our policies.~~ You can browse our policies on our GitHub repository. If you have questions about policies or requests for corrections to policies, please submit the **Policy Change Review Form**.

We are audited on an annual basis, and sometimes more frequently. In the case of an audit, we will inform all members of the company.

###Training

All employees are required to complete HIPAA training upon joining the Company. Introductory training is located in the HIPAA Training section of the HIPAA Repository on GitHub. Once training has been completed, you must complete the **HIPAA Training Form**. If you ever have questions about HIPAA, please email [Kevin Coker](mailto:kcoker@molecularmatch.com).

###Physical Security of Computer and Phones
 
You are asked to take reasonable steps to ensure the protection of your computer and phone including damage from improper use, food and drink spillage, and good housekeeping procedures.

###Logical Security of Workstations
 
All employees are to follow the workstation security policies outlined in the **Employee and Workstation Use Policies**. Specifically, all systems are required to have the following setings:

* Filevault or Bitlocker encryption turned on;
* Firewall turned on;
* Password rules for workstations:
     * At least 8 characters long;
     * Must contain at least one letter, one number, and one special character;
     * Must be changed every 90 days;
     * Passwords can't be reused for 1 year; 
* The following message should be added to the lock screen: *This computer is owned by **((Who owns the computer??))**. By logging in, unlocking, and/or using this computer you acknowledge you have seen, and follow, all states policies in our GitHub Repository and have completed this training. Please contact us if you have problems with this - [Kevin Coker, CEO](mailto:kcoker@molecularmatch.com)*

Additionally, only approved software required for business is allowed on workstations. Logs should be reviewed on a monthly basis for suspicious activity. For questions on log review, please contact [Nick Tackes](mailto:ntackes@molecularmatch.com).

##Policies

###Professionalism
At all times, and in all circumstances where employee is acting on behalf of the Company or is seen to be associated with the Company, the employee is to act in a professional manner. This includes statements about, pertaining to, or somehow relating to the Company, its employees, its partners, its customers, or its competitors.

###Accountability
Every employee, from founder to janitor, is accountable for their work. We will recognize and celebrate your successes, and we will will also explore when mistakes are made, or things do not go as planned. Our objective as a company is to constantly learn and improve, and we want each and every one of us to constantly learn and improve because, well, we are the company. We will give you enough rope to hang yourself, or to lasso the biggest bull you can find. The choice is yours. In a sense our ideal team is made up of startups of one - each of you own your work and take initiative to succeed. You also explore and test constantly, documenting what you learned in some way that we all benefit.

Additionally, system access and usage are monitored and logged. This ties partially to the nature of our business being compliance as well as having a strong information security program in place.

###Working
We expect all employees to be available during business hours unless other arrangements have been made. There is flexibility in hours, and work location, but you should generally be available via chat every day. We don’t count hours but plan for all work to be completed as if you are working full time. Full time doesn’t mean 40 hours, but it means getting your work done and delivered by deadlines, or letting us know why certain deadlines are not realistic. If you are a remote worker, this does place an additional burden on you to provide transparency and visibility into your work and availability.
Internet Use. We expect Internet use while on the company network, or anytime with the company’s computer, to be professional in nature. Do not frequent sites with questionable content at any time. If you need additional clarification on this, please email [Kevin Coker](mailto:kcoker@molecularmatch.com).

###Communication
* *Task Management Software and Slack*. The objective of internal communication is to make all, or as much as possible, contextual, fast, and easy to manage. As such, the majority of communication should take place via HipChat, iDoneThis, and Jira/Confluence. For any of these, if you want a response from a specific person or a group of people, be sure that you @mention them. Regarding HipChat, if you want to share a link or something else of interest with the whole company, please post that to the main room. If you want to create a HipChat room, please do so but make sure you post an announcement of the room to the entire group with @all.
* *Email*. Email is rarely the best choice, but is still the preferred method of communication when a formal response is required within 24 hours. In this case, it is expected that a response will be given within 24 hours, even if that response is only to state that a full response should be expected in a certain amount of time. This policy applies to both internal and external email.
* *Google Hangouts*. It is expected that when you are working you will be available for Hangouts on demand. Being a geographically dispersed teams requires that we stay available, and that sometimes requires more than HipChat/IM.
* *Phone*. Phone, meaning voice or text (SMS/iMessage) is not the preferred method for internal communication. It should be used sparingly as it is a distraction and a drain on productivity.

###Meetings

* *Daily Meetings*. **((How do you do your daily standups??  Who runs them? Who comes? Protocol if going to miss?))**
* *Retrospectives*. At the conclusion of each sprint we hold retrospectives, which run for about an hour. During this time we celebrate our success over the sprint, and try to learn and improve by recognizing and acknowledging mistakes and areas of improvement.
* *1 on 1 Meetings*. At least every 2 weeks you should sit down, or the very least have a call, with **((Who does the 1on1 meetings?)) to discuss how things are going - what is working, what is not working, what can we do to make things better.

###Benefits
 
Your salary or wage will be reviewed every 12 months and adjusted in line with your performance and commiserate, to an extent, with the stage of the company. The review process will be largely informal, transparent, and participatory for you. The salary review process will take into account your performance in your role, market rates for your role and the Company's ability to pay. Reviews will not necessarily lead to an increase.
 
###Expense reimbursement
 
Where expenses have been incurred in the performance of your duties and provided that you have obtained your manager’s approval to incur the expense, the Company will reimburse you for all reasonable travel and other expenses incurred as part of undertaking your role. You should submit all receipts for any expense over $25. **((How are expenses documentated and submitted??))**
 
###Performance Development
  
The aim of our performance appraisal process is to provide you with guidance, to help you to achieve your job and career goals, to recognise your achievements. You will have the opportunity to participate in planning your work and setting your goals in conjunction with on an ongoing basis and during your annual appraisal meeting. You will provide you with regular coaching and feedback. The performance appraisal process is an opportunity for two way communication and honest feedback about your work and your future career.
 
The Company sees the training and development of its employees as essential to achieving its goals. You are invited to discuss your training needs during your formal performance appraisal meeting or with your immediate manager at any time. This might include formal classes, certificates, online training, and/or conferences. Founders are responsible for approving all training or courses of study.
 
###Conflict of Interest
 
During your employment, you must not undertake any activity or have any interest (e.g. memberships, directorships, shares, or contract) with any person or in any organisation which may constitute a conflict of interest with the Company. You must notify [Kevin Coker](mailto:kcoker@molecularmatch.com) immediately upon becoming aware of any potential or actual conflict of interest involving them during your employment. Any work undertaken with other organisations must have the approval of the CEO to ensure it does not interfere or create a conflict with your main employment with the Company. If you’re not sure whether there is a conflict or not, please email us at [Kevin Coker](mailto:kcoker@molecularmatch.com).
 
###Confidentiality
