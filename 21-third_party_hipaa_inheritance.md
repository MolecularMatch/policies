#HIPAA Inheritance for Catalyze Customers

MolecularMatch uses a compliant hosted software infrastructure by a Sucontractor.  This Platform as a Service Subcontractor (PaaS Subcontractor) has been through a HIPAA compliance audit by a national, third-party compliance firm, to validate and map organizational policies and technical settings to HIPAA rules. The PaaS Subcontractor is currently undergoing a HITRUST audit to achieve HITRUST Certification.

The PaaS Subcontractor has signed a business associate agreements (BAAs) with our Company. This BAAs outlines t'she PaaS Subcontractor obligations and our own obligations, as well as liability in the case of a breach. In providing infrastructure and managing security configurations that are a part of the technology requirements that exist in HIPAA and HITRUST, as well as future compliance frameworks, the PaaS Subcontractor manages various aspects of compliance for our Company. The aspects of compliance that the PaaS Subcontractor manages for our Company are inherited by our Company, and the PaaS Subcontractor assumes the risk associated with those aspects of compliance. In doing so,  the PaaS Subcontractor  helps our Compay achieve and maintain compliance, as well as mitigates our Company's risk.

Certain aspects of compliance cannot be inherited. Because of this in order to achieve full compliance or HITRUST Certification, our Company has implemented certain organizational policies. These policies and aspects of compliance fall outside of the services and obligations of  the PaaS Subcontractor.

Below are mappings of HIPAA Rules to the PaaS Subcontractor controls and a mapping of what Rules are inherited by our Company.
