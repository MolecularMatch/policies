## Data Retention Policy

* Data is stored on PaaS Subcontractor systems as part of subcontracted service. 
* Once we cease to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are taken:
	1. Either reinstate the account, if deemed appropriate or necessary. 
	2. If we do not wish to reinstate account, we will download all data in a secure and encrypted manner. 
	3. Otherwise we can request for the existing PaaS Subcontractor to retain backups of existing data for a negotiated price.
	3. After data has been removed from PaaS Subcontractor's servers, both parts will ensure the *Disposable Media Policy* and all other applicable policies will be followed.  As such, no trace of data shall be allowed to remain after leaving PaaS Vendor.
