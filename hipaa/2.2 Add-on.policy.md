#HIPAA Inheritance for Platform Add-on Customers

##Compliace Inheritance
Catalyze provides compliant hosted software infrastructure for its Customers. Catalyze has been through a HIPAA compliance audit by a national, 3rd party compliance firm, to validate and map organizational policies and technical settings to HIPAA rules. Catalyze is currently undergoing a HITRUST audit to achieve HITRUST Certification.

Catalyze signs business associate agreements (BAAs) with its Customers. These BAAs outline Catalyze obligations and Customer obligations, as well as liability in the case of a breach. In providing infrastructure and managing security configurations that are a part of the technology requirements that exist in HIPAA and HITRUST, as well as future compliance frameworks, Catalyze manages various aspects of compliance for Customers. The aspects of compliance that Catalyze manages for Customers are inherited by Customers, and Catalyze assumes the risk associated with those aspects of compliance. In doing so, Catalyze helps Customers achieve and maintain compliance, as well as mitigates Customers risk.

Certain aspects of compliance cannot be inherited. Because of this, Catalyze Customers, in order to achieve full compliance or HITRUST Certification, must implement certain organizational policies. These policies and aspects of compliance fall outside of the services and obligations of Catalyze.

Below are mappings of HIPAA Rules to Catalyze controls and a mapping of what Rules are inherited by Customers.
